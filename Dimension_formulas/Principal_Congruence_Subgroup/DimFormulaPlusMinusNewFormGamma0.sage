""" 
The following two precedures compute the dimension
of the plus and minus subspaces of the space of new 
forms on Gamma_0(2). Here the plus and minus signs 
correspond to the sign of the eigenvalues of the 
Atkin-Lehner involution acting on the space of new 
forms on Gamma_0(2).
The formulas are taken from Theorem 2 of

    Refined dimensions of cusp forms, and equidistribution and bias of signs

WARNING: In Theorem 2 of [1] the plus/minus signs correspond to 
         w_f which is the sign in the functional equation of L(f,s)
         for f a new form on Gamma_0(2) so 
         w_f=(-1)^{k/2} \\lambda_{W_2} for f \\in S_{k}(Gamma_0(2))^{new}
